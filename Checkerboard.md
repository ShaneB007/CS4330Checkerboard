+# Reflect on the work you did for the challenge.
+The goal of the assignment was to use JavaFX to build auto build a checkerboard type object, with the number of squares determined by a menu item that could be changed at any time, as well as a color change option in the same form. 
+I think that work wise, it was relatively simple to look at work we had done in class and create a working piece of software that fit the requirements. The longest part for me was dealing with JavaFX and getting things to look just right, but other than that it was a pretty straight forward execution.
+ 
+# How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?
+I would like to think that I have a pretty solid basis in Java, and fundamentally understand how to visualize a project and understand how I want to complete it. The more I work with a language the easier it becomes to quickly decide how I want a project to look and then I just start writing. As I run into issues, there may be some changes but in most cases it looks pretty much how I pictured it.
+
+# How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?
+I believe I met the requirements in full, and definitely made a project with the flexibility to expand and turn into a fully working checkers game, which I think was the intention.
+
+# How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
+Compared to the posted solution, my project matched it pretty closely, with a few differences. The main thing that stood out to me was that my project lacked in depth comments, which definitely needs work on my end. The other difference I noticed was in the modularity of smaller parts of code, I think that the example project did a better job of keeping different components separate.
+
+# How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
+1. Make sure that I put plenty of comments in, to make the project easier for someone else to work on and make changes in the future.
+2. Keep things modular, so that there is improved flexibility for future iterations.
